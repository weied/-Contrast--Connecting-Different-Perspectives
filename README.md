# -Contrast--Connecting-Different-Perspectives
Contrast is an application that connects people with different perspectives so that they can get out of their bubbles, be more grounded, and to learn to appreciate the other point of view. We currently have a sketch-up, rudimentary algorithm, and a 2-minute pitch presentation.

It is created by Leo Cai, Kathy Chiu, Alex Duong, and Edward Wei with the original idea coming from Edward Wei in #Team Orange in INFO 200 Summer 2017 at the University of Washington.
